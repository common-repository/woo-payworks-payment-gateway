Accept Credit Cards on your WooCommerce store. Pay via PayWorks


== Description ==
This is a PayWorks Pro Payment Gateway for WooCommerce.

If the customer can't pay with your payment gateways, give him the opportunity to submit the order and pay via PayWorks. The plugin is very simple and effective. The more important is it's very easy to setup and use.

PayWorks Pro allows you to securely sell your products online using In-Context Checkout to help you meet security requirements without causing your theme to suffer.  In-Context Checkout uses an api, hosted on PayWorks' servers, that overlays the checkout form and provides a secure means for your customers to enter their account information.

Also, with Integrated PayWorks Setup (Easy Setup), connecting to PayWorks is as simple, you just have to enter your user id on PayWorks and the secret key. Those can be found in your PayWorks dashboard.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.4 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WooCommerce PayWorks Pro Payment Gateway" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The
WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
